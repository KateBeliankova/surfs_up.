# Analysis using Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and Flask for Surf and ice cream shop

The present analysis gives an overview of seasonal temperature and precipitation amount in Oahu (Hawaii) for 2010-2017 (June vs. December). 

## Precipitation analysis (June vs. December)

For the both month the minimum amount of precipitation is 0.0, average amount in December is greater than in June for about 57% (0.22 in December vs 0.14 in June, and the maximum precipitation in December exceed the maximum in June by 45% (6.42 in December vs. 4.43 in June). So summer in Oahu is more dry in comparison to winter season. 

## Temperature analysis (June vs. December)

As was mentioned above, in June we observed less precipitation than in December, so it was expected that minimum, average and maximum temperature in June will be higher than in December. So Difference between June minimum temperature and December minimum temperature is equal to 8 degree, difference in maximum temperatures is equal to 2 degrees. 
Average temperature in June is 75 degree while in December 71.

## Summary 

According to the analysis the difference in precipitation and temperatures is not drastic, so Surf shop might be popular year-round. 

## To get more comprehensive picture itâ€™s recommended to make an additional analysis:

1.	Conduct analysis about seasonal windspeed and wind direction
2.	Additional analysis about wave heights, swell period and swell direction
3.	Complete the analysis with tide information.
